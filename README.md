# Retrieval Augmented Generation using Langchain

A minimalistic RAG implementation (barely) that can answer legal questions using the Indian Constituition. 

An alternative to TuJantaNahiMeraBaapKaunHai. Because who needs a lawyer?

## How to run
1. Create a .env file and put in your OPENAI key like so
```OPENAI_API_KEY="youwish"```

2. ```python main.py --question "What to do if signal pe police took meri gaadi ki chaabi?"```

3. Get laughed at lol.


# Disclaimer
This is not a replacement for actual legal advice. If you find yourself in a courtroom, waving your printout of Langchain's response, you might need more help than a Python script can provide.

# Contributors
Feel free to open issues, preferably legal ones, and I'll ignore them like a seasoned politician. 

Yes. I spent more time on this than the code... can you blame me?
